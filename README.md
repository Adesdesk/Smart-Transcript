# Smart-Transcript
Smart-Transcript is a Decentralized Application proposed by Adeola David A. to Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges, and Specialized Tertiary Institutions for a smarter approach to managing the storage, retrieval, and distribution of their graduates' academic transcripts. This dApp takes advantage of the blockchain's decentralization, permanence, immutability, and transparency, to offer institutions a more efficient way to maintain copies of academic transcripts. It guarantees that dispatched transcript copies remain confidential and authentic, while eliminating the issues of delay in delivery, risks of misplacement in transit, and uncertainties surrounding the identity of the sender institution. This solution is work in progress, and a novel idea proposed by Adeola David A. Built on the Ethereum network, Smart-Transcript is powered by a smart contract that allows institutions imprint unique cryptographically signed records of each student's academic transcript to the blockchain as a non-fungible token NFT. This record is retrievable with easy execution of the smart contract, giving a destination institution access to the same, eliminating questions of authenticity and identity verification. While institutions are at liberty to monetize the process still, this solution will translate to lesser costs borne by the graduate, since a significant portion of the amount spent on physical dispatch of the transcript can now be saved.
