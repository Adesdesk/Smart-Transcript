# Smart-Transcript
### A Decentralized Application by Adeola David Adelakun - January 2023 Version

Smart-Transcript is a Decentralized Application proposed by Adeola David Adelakun to academic institutions and other categories of certificate issuing bodies for a smarter approach to managing the storage, retrieval, and distribution of their graduates' academic transcripts and certificates. This dApp takes advantage of the blockchain's decentralization, permanence, immutability, and transparency, to offer institutions a more efficient way to maintain copies of academic transcripts and other documents.

Built (at this stage) on Ethereum's Goerli test network, Smart-Transcript is powered by a smart contract that allows institutions cryptographically sign a record of each graduate's academic transcript and have it stored on the blockchain as a non-fungible token NFT. This guarantees that dispatched transcript copies remain confidential and authentic, while eliminating the issues of delay in delivery, risks of misplacement in transit, and uncertainties surrounding the identity of the issuing institution. This solution is a novel idea conceived, designed and developed by Adeola.

Smart-Transcript uses a Next.js-based user interface via which users, mainly handlers for institutions, can connect a designated ethereum wallet to tokenize actual copies of transcripts and certificates. The user interface is easy to use, allowing institutions store an immutable record of these vital documents to te blockchain, and in turn, easily retrieve details of the source and ownership of other documents. The following are snapshots of the Smart-Transcript home page and the "Tokenize" dashboard.

### The "Tokenize" Dashboard

The on-chain record is retrievable with easy execution of the smart contract's functions, giving a destination institution access to the same unaltered record. This eliminates questions of authenticity and ownership or issuer conflicts. While institutions are at liberty to monetize the process still, this solution will translate to lesser costs borne by the graduate, since a significant portion of the amount spent on physical dispatch of the transcript can now be saved.

Institutions in real life do reserve the right to withdraw or revoke a previously issued certificate in a situtation where the bearer is found unworthy of such qualification. While blockchain transactions are ideally known as immutable, the Smart-Transcript DApp employs a call to the "burn" function of its smart contract source code in order to revoke previously tokenized documents. This ensures that institutions can retain all rights they reserved as applicable to the hard copy vital documents they have always issued. The following is a snapshot of the "Revoke Copy" dashboard where this feature can be executed.
