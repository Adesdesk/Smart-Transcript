Smart-Transcript is a Decentralized Application proposed by Adeola David Adelakun to academic institutions and other categories of certificate issuing bodies for a smarter approach to managing the storage, retrieval, and distribution of their graduates' academic transcripts and certificates. This dApp takes advantage of the blockchain's decentralization, permanence, immutability, and transparency, to offer institutions a more efficient way to maintain copies of academic transcripts and other documents. 

It guarantees that dispatched transcript copies remain confidential and authentic, while eliminating the issues of delay in delivery, risks of misplacement in transit, and uncertainties surrounding the identity of the issuing institution. This solution is a novel idea conceived, designed abd developed by Adeola. Built on Ethereum's Goerli test network, Smart-Transcript is powered by a smart contract that allows institutions cryptographically sign a record of each student's academic transcript and have it stored on the blockchain as a non-fungible token NFT. 

This record is retrievable with easy execution of the smart contract's functions, giving a destination institution access to the same unaltered record. This eliminates questions of authenticity and ownership or issuer conflicts. While institutions are at liberty to monetize the process still, this solution will translate to lesser costs borne by the graduate, since a significant portion of the amount spent on physical dispatch of the transcript can now be saved.
